Microstates of Equivalent and Non-Equivalent Electrons

A Python program was developed that used the Pauli Exclusion Concept and the L-S coupling principle to build the microstate in accordance with the filled and half-filled subshell electronic configuration. The microstate for non-equivalent electrons of configurations ss, sp, sd, sf, pp, pd, pf, dd, df, and ff, as well as equivalent electrons of configuration s1, s2, p1, p2, p3, p4, p5, d1, d2, d3, d4, d5, d6, d7, d8, d9, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12, f13.

Program provides 2 user inputs. "0 for microstates of equivalent electrons and 1 for Non-Equivalent electrons".
Console will show all possible microstates along with their term symbols.
